In order to compile s3fs with encryption you will need the following packages:

	S3FS:         
•	Build-essential
•	Libfuse-dev
•	Libbcurl4-openssl-dev
•	Libxml2-dev
•	Mime-support

	CryptoPP:
•	libcrypto++-utils
•	libcrypto++9
•	libcrypto++9-dbg
•	libcrypto++-dev
•	libcrypto++-doc

To download s3fs with encryption simply go to 
	https://github.com/Gilgamesh22/s3fs-fuse/archive/master.zip
	
After downloading simply unzip the file using the tar command
	tar -zxvf  s3fs-fuse-master.zip

After unzipping simply use the following commands
	sudo ./configure --prefix=/usr
	sudo make
	sudo make install
 
before mounting you need to configure the /etc/.passwd-s3fs file. This file contains you accessKey and secretAccessKey to access your bucket. The file needs to be in the following format
	accessKey: secretAccessKey
	
Finally before running s3fs you need to change the permissions of the file to be able to read and write.
	sudo chmod 640 /etc/passwd-s3fs
	
To run simply use the following command. Please note replace mybucket with you actual bucket name. Also replace key with you actual encryption key. also note the key needs to be 16 characters long.
	sudo /usr/bin/s3fs mybucket /mnt -o allow_other –k Key
